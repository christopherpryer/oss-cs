Welcome to my oss-cs repository!

My name is Chris Pryer and I've been working on my Computer Science studies for the past year. In addition
to my Open Source Society University coordinated studies for CS, I also study Mathematics and Management
Information Systems at Rowan University. I began my programming studies at the beginning of my 2015 summer;
so around may 10th. Realistically, after a few weeks of putting together a plan and organizing information,
I had not started programming and coordinated my efforts until early June. I began with an Introduction to
Java course [pending link/reference] that I would end up completing with a few solid weeks of summer left.
Actually it was more than a month of free time I would allocate for more studies. I ended up veering off
into the basics of web development and design. I learned languages like HTML5, CSS3, and started to try out
some JavaScript by the end of my Fall 2015 semester. Over the winter I spent time looking into resources and
researching my options. Around the time the Spring semester of 2016 began, I made the decision to commit to
Open Source Society University's Computer Science program and enough for a minor in Mathematics at
Rowan University.

This repository and generally the project this leads to are both still being constructed. Due to how busy I
have been this semester, I don't plan to make serious contributions and configure the program to meet my needs
until the summer. But over the summer I will begin to build this up. Also the information this would host will
be linked to OSS University's student repo as well as feed an application I hope to develop soon. Until then
enjoy checking out the progress!
